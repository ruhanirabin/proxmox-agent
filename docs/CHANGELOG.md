## 0.7.7

- feat: add guided notification setup in installer (`none`, `telegram`, `webhook`, `both`) with required value prompts.
- improve: enforce webhook URL validation and required Telegram fields during guided install.
- feat: add Docker-based non-live smoke test script for WSL2/local validation of installer flow.

## 0.7.6

- fix: prevent installer source-path corruption by isolating UI/spinner output from command-substitution output.
- improve: add mandatory confirmation gate before mutation in both bootstrap installer and `proxmox-agent install`.
- feat: add beginner-friendly install wizard for backup repo path, branch, remote URL, and log retention setup.
- improve: add guided GitHub SSH retry loop during install to help users complete authentication without manual debugging.

## 0.7.5

## 0.7.4

- improve: add configurable log retention for all `pa-*` custom logs with global and per-script overrides.
- improve: standardize runtime log cleanup through shared helper logic to keep retention behavior consistent.
- improve: document version-sync rules so `VERSION`, changelog release headers, and runtime version generation stay aligned.
- feat: add guided bootstrap installer (`install.sh`) for curl-pipe installation flow with preflight and source fetch prompts.
- improve: expand `proxmox-agent install` to provide clearer preflight output, prior-install detection, and missing remote guidance.

## 0.7.3

- improve: normalize managed artifact naming to canonical `pa-*` for scripts, units, env, and runtime version files.
- feat: add automatic legacy-node migration during `proxmox-agent install` and `proxmox-agent upgrade`.
- fix: prevent duplicate old/new unit scheduling by stopping and disabling legacy units during migration.
- feat: add rollback-safe migration snapshots for install and upgrade under `/root/proxmox-agent-backups/`.
- improve: add doctor migration visibility with explicit legacy artifact status reporting.
- improve: standardize runtime log naming to `pa-*` paths for easier operations monitoring.

## 0.7.2

- improve: update backup flow to explicit allowlist and default secret exclusion.
- improve: update shutdown flow to run a pre-shutdown backup and send webhook events.
- improve: update unit files to run scripts from `/usr/local/bin`.
